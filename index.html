			<span class="profiletext">I have co-founded and helped grow a couple of tech startups over the past decade (in business development and strategy roles).  As a Harvard MBA and "business guy", everyone thinks I'm insane for wanting to learn how to code.  I ignore them all because the ability to understand technology, build tangible products, and make improvements to our solutions is incredibly...even as the business co-founder.  Excel and Powerpoint are nowhere near as cool as javascript!  </span>

			<span class="profiletext"><br><br>Outside of work, I love to surf, play guitar, sing, play soccer, travel, and eat Peruvian food!  This is a sample of my work thus-far, and more cool things are on the way.  Thanks for visiting my portfolio page!</span>
