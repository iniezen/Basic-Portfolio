		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<img id="profilepic" src="assets/images/israelpic.jpg">
		<span>I'm very passionate about tech startups, and have co-founded and helped grow a couple over the past decade (typically in a business role, as CEO or head of business development and strategy).  As a Harvard MBA and "business guy", everyone always told me "you don't need to know how to code".  I ignored them all because the ability to understand technology, build tangible products, and make improvements to our solutions is very rewarding to me...even as the business co-founder.  Excel and Powerpoint are nowhere near as cool as javascript!  </span>

		<span>Outside of work, I love to surf, play guitar, sing, play soccer, travel, and eat Peruvian food!  This is a sample of my work thus-far, which I expect to continuously update as I keep learning how to build cool things.  Thanks for visiting my portfolio page!</span>
